## About The Project


Podcast reviews are one signal to help listeners decide if they want to hear a show particularly with people new to podcasts, we found engaging, visually interesting podcast art and the name of the show to be most important. Ad revenue for podcasting grew by over 50% from 2017 to 2018 and is expected to grow over 1,000% from 2015 to 2020. For podcasts that have more than 5000 downloads per month, there is a growing market of companies that are willing to sponsor the podcast
</br>
So our goal was to create an app which makes it easier for podcast listeners to read and post reviews about a particular podcast. It will help grow a community of interested podcast listeners in a field they are interested in. Also, podcast listeners get to explore podcasts or topics they might not have heard about earlier. We can check the trending podcasts and see what our friends and followers are listening to. This system of reviews also helps the creator to improve and also dive into the topics his listeners want to listen to.
