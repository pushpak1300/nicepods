Don't worry though, we have guests on, good ones too!\n\nFire in the Hole is a new conversational podcast by Jason Ambrus and Richard Lajoie that covers a range of topics that we sorta make up as we go along. The ultimate idea is to get a real conversation going, not just knee-jerk react to ideas. Let's get to the bottom of things, or at least have a laugh, a few beers, and take our brains out for a little jog.\n\nFitH also features guest appearances from a wide range of professionals, artists, and just cool people in general.",

We pull back the curtain on the socio-political exploration that is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. We'll blow your mind when we show that Yeezus is one, cohesive narrative. And how The Life of Pablo might be Kanye's most brilliant album yet. \n\nWe also get into some Kanye news, North West news, and have the most insane Jay-Z news you will ever hear.

But we are talking about mindfulness. It is about being in the moment. It is about paying attention. It is about nonjudgmental attitude. It is about awareness.  It is about making wiser decisions. I am talking about lessons I've learned on my Martial Arts and Yoga journey, and what I've learned practicing meditation. My episodes are inspired by lessons I got from World's greatest success and leadership teachers, like Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, Maxwell Maltz, Og Mandino, John Maxwell, David J. Schwartz, Zig Ziglar, Robert Kiyosaki, Dr. Shed Helmstetter, and many many others.",

Each episode is hosted by yoga teacher & business graduate, Amanda Kingsmith, and features different, successful and inspiring yoga teachers who share their experiences in the yoga world, and the business lessons they have learned throughout their careers. Guests range from full-time yoga teachers, yoga studio owners, teachers who have branched off to create their own businesses, teachers who have developed their own teacher training, and much more.",
